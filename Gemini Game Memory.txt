Project: Cryptids Game. Concept: A card collecting game where players open packs to collect cryptid cards. The long-term goal is to add online trading and Player-vs-Player (PvP) battles. Tech Stack: Hosted on GitHub Pages: https://cglover-cmd.github.io/Cryptids/index.html. Coded entirely within a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Uses browser localStorage for all user data (accounts, card collections, currency). Integrates Google OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for user login. All card images are AI-generated. Data to Save: Key user data includes username, list of collectedCardIds, playerDeckIds, and cryptidCoins. In-Game Currency: "Cryptid Coins" are used to open card packs. Future plans include expanding their use. Key Development Priorities: Implement Card Effects: The unique effect text on each card (e.g., "Vampiric Bite") needs to be coded into the battle logic. This is the most important next step for gameplay depth. Backend Transition: To enable online features like trading and PvP, the game will need to move from localStorage to a server-side backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase). Core Feature Expansion: Build the online trading system and PvP battle mode. Economy & Engagement: Add features like a daily card shop, achievements, or quests to enhance player retention. When coding, only add the specific piece of code or feature that is requested. Do not alter the rest of the code whatsoever. If you are unsure about any piece of the request or need clarification, ask before implementing.
