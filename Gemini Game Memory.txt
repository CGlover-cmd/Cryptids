Save these paragraphs separately through Gemini because there is a word count per "saved information" tab.




If there is any piece of the game that is added that would make any of the Gemini saved information about the game false, irrelevant, or inaccurate in any way, or if there is any crucial information that you think should be added to this information for your long term storage, remind me through your response (within the Gemini chat) in all caps and bold in large font what should be changed or added about the Gemini saved info. THE PROJECT IS STRUCTURED WITH SEPARATE FILES FOR MARKUP, STYLING, AND LOGIC: INDEX.HTML, STYLE.CSS, SCRIPT.JS, AND ACCOUNT_PORTAL.HTML (WHICH HAS ITS OWN EMBEDDED CSS AND WILL USE A NEW ACCOUNT_PORTAL.JS FILE). 


The project is a card collecting game called Cryptids, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The core concept involves players opening packs to collect cards featuring AI-generated art of various cryptids, with the long-term goal of enabling online trading and Player-vs-Player (PvP) battles. The game is built as a single-page application using index.html, style.css, and script.js, and it relies on browser localStorage for all user data, including accounts, card collections (collectedCardIds, playerDeckIds), and the in-game currency, "Cryptid Coins." User authentication is handled through a combination of a native username/password system and Google OAuth 2.0. The title screen is designed to be responsive, using different images for landscape and portrait orientations. The key development priorities are, first, to implement the unique effects for each card to add depth to the battle logic. Following that, the plan is to migrate the data storage from localStorage to a proper backend service like Firebase or Supabase to support the primary goals of building an online trading system and a PvP battle mode. Finally, future plans include expanding the game's economy and engagement with features like a daily card shop, achievements, or quests.
