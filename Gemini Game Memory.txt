Save these paragraphs separately through Gemini because there is a word count per "saved information" tab.




If there is any piece of the game that is added that would make any of the Gemini saved information about the game false, irrelevant, or inaccurate in any way, or if there is any crucial information that you think should be added to this information for your long term storage, remind me through your response (within the Gemini chat) in all caps and bold in large font what should be changed or added about the Gemini saved info. Since there is now 3 files as a part of my game: HTML, CSS, and JS, only provide the code for one file at at time. After you provide the code, wait until a response from me until giving me the next file code.


Project: Cryptids Game. Concept: A card collecting game where players open packs to collect cryptid cards. The long-term goal is to add online trading and Player-vs-Player (PvP) battles. Tech Stack: Hosted on GitHub Pages: https://cglover-cmd.github.io/Cryptids/index.html. The project is structured with separate files for markup, styling, and logic: index.html, style.css, and script.js. It uses browser localStorage for all user data (accounts, card collections, currency) and integrates Google OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for user login. Assets: All card images are AI-generated. The title screen uses two responsive images: title_screen_169.jpg (landscape) and title_scsreen_mobile.jpg (portrait). Data to Save: Key user data includes username, a list of collectedCardIds, playerDeckIds, and cryptidCoins. In-Game Currency: "Cryptid Coins" are used to open card packs. Future plans include expanding their use. Key Development Priorities: Implement Card Effects: The unique effect text on each card (e.g., "Vampiric Bite") needs to be coded into the battle logic. This is the most important next step for gameplay depth. Backend Transition: To enable online features like trading and PvP, the game will need to move from localStorage to a server-side backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase). Core Feature Expansion: Build the online trading system and PvP battle mode. Economy & Engagement: Add features like a daily card shop, achievements, or quests to enhance player retention.
