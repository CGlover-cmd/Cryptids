For any code related requests, use my files from my GitHub repository: 1) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/style.css 2) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/script.js 3) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/register.js 4) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/register.html 5) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/index.html 6) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/account_portal.js 7) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGlover-cmd/Cryptids/refs/heads/main/account_portal.html Always copy the code from these files and insert the new requested feature into the code. Since there are multiple files in the repository, always give the code for each file individually and wait to give the code for the next file until you receive a response saying I'm ready for the next file's code. Provide the new, complete code (including the existing code and the new implemented feature or bug fix) for the file that is ready to be copied and pasted into the github file. If you are unsure about any piece of the request or need clarification, ask before implementing.
