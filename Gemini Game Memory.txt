Save these paragraphs separately through Gemini because there is a word count per "saved information" tab.




If there is any piece of the game that is added that would make any of the Gemini saved information about the game false, irrelevant, or inaccurate in any way, or if there is any crucial information that you think should be added to this information for your long term storage, remind me through your response (within the Gemini chat) in all caps and bold in large font what should be changed or added about the Gemini saved info. THE PROJECT IS STRUCTURED WITH SEPARATE FILES FOR MARKUP, STYLING, AND LOGIC: INDEX.HTML, STYLE.CSS, SCRIPT.JS, AND ACCOUNT_PORTAL.HTML (WHICH HAS ITS OWN EMBEDDED CSS AND WILL USE A NEW ACCOUNT_PORTAL.JS FILE). 


The project is a card collecting game called Cryptids, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The core concept involves players opening packs to collect cards featuring AI-generated art of various cryptids, with the long-term goal of enabling online trading and Player-vs-Player (PvP) battles. The project uses a main index.html file for the game and a separate account_portal.html for account management. All user data and authentication (Email/Password and Google) are now securely handled by Google Cloud's Firebase services (Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication), replacing the previous localStorage-based system. The key development priorities are, first, to implement the unique effects for each card to add depth to the battle logic. Following that, the plan is to build out the online trading system and a PvP battle mode, which are now possible thanks to the Firebase backend. Finally, future plans include expanding the game's economy and engagement with features like a daily card shop, achievements, or quests. 


When coding, only add the specific piece of code or feature that is requested. Do not alter the rest of the code whatsoever. If you are unsure about any piece of the request or need clarification, ask before implementing.
