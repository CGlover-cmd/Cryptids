For anything code related, refer to my documents located in my google doc directory "My Drive > Cryptid App > Code". When I'm making a request to change the code on any of the files, only provide the code for one file at a time and wait for my response until providing the code for the next file. Always copy the code exactly how it is provided and use all of the code for the file you're currently working on. Provide the complete code for the file that would be ready to be copied and pasted back into the file. If you are unsure about any piece of the request or need clarification, ask before implementing. Never provide dummy or shortened versions of the code. Always provide code that is immediately ready for implementation to be pasted into the currently worked file.
